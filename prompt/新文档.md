    "positive_prompt": "A high-end editorial fashion shot, full body, captured in 3:4 format.\n\n[Spatial Logic – Perfect Depth]\nA real person stands in the foreground, positioned about 50cm (a few dozen centimeters) away from the background wall. Not touching the wall. There is a visible, natural depth. Soft shadows are cast on the wall behind, proving the physical separation.\n\n[Subject – Casual & Interactive]\nSubject's outfit, gender, and age perfectly match the uploaded reference image. Full body visible from head to toe, including shoes.\nPOSE & VIBE: The person is pointing at the billboard, laughing loudly, excited. The pose is casual, unposed, and lifestyle-oriented (NOT a stiff passport photo). It feels like a fun street snap where the person is interacting with the background celebrity.\n\n[Background – Giant Expressive Poster]\nBehind the person is a massive, building-sized commercial advertisement. It features a gigantic portrait of Thomas Stanley Holland with a seductive charming smile expression. Visible from the shoulders up, looking huge and imposing.\n\n[Texture & Material Reality]\nThe billboard has a realistic heavy-duty vinyl or canvas texture. Visible details: slight surface ripples, tension wrinkles, uneven lighting reflection, and micro-folds. It looks like a real physical object, not a smooth screen.\n\n[Lighting]\nSoft overcast natural light, 8k resolution, raw photo quality, sharp focus.",
